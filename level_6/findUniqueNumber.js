/*REQUIREMENTS:
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.
The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.*/


//SOLUTION:
function findUniq(arr) {
    let obj = {};

    arr.forEach(el => !obj[el] ? obj[el] = 1 : obj[el]++);

    for(let key in obj){
        if(obj[key] == 1){
            return +key;
        }
    }

}
